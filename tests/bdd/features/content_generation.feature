    When slide content is created
    Then it should use clear, simple language
    And it should avoid unnecessary jargon
    And it should include definitions for technical terms
    And it should have good contrast between text and background

  Scenario: Cultural Sensitivity in Examples
    Given I am generating content with examples
    When examples are included in slides
    Then they should be culturally neutral
    And they should represent diverse scenarios
    And they should avoid cultural assumptions
    And they should be inclusive of different backgrounds

Feature: Performance and Scalability
  As a system administrator
  I want content generation to be efficient and scalable
  So that the system can handle multiple users and large amounts of content

  Scenario: Large Configuration Handling
    Given I have a configuration with 50 presentation templates
    And each template has 100 slides
    When the presentation generator is initialized
    Then it should load the configuration without performance issues
    And it should be able to generate any slide efficiently
    And memory usage should remain reasonable

  Scenario: Concurrent Content Generation
    Given multiple users are requesting content simultaneously
    When 10 users request slide generation at the same time
    Then all requests should be processed successfully
    And response times should remain acceptable (under 2 seconds)
    And the system should not experience performance degradation

  Scenario: Content Caching and Optimization
    Given frequently requested content exists
    When the same slide is requested multiple times
    Then the system should optimize for repeated requests
    And response times should improve for cached content
    And memory usage should be optimized for frequent access patterns
